# Julyo

Hello 👋
I'm Julyo Computer Science student @ Binus University. Actually I don't really like to code but I have to do it because it my obligation as Computer Science Student 🥲. I use github for documenting and save my past projects. I'm passionate in Product Design and like to create a nice User Interface Design for website and mobile. Although I don't like coding, I like to exploring Web Design using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. 

You can see my design portfolio that I build using webflow through the link 👉 https://julyo11.webflow.io/ 
Get in touch with me 👉 https://linktr.ee/julyo11

Thank you and have a nice day ❤️
