# Hello Everyone 👋 <br>

I'm Julyo Computer Science student @ Binus University. Actually, I don't really like to code but I have to do it because it's my responsibilities as Computer Science Student 🥲. I use Github for documenting and save my past projects. I'm passionate about Product Design and like to create a nice User Interface Design for websites and mobile. Although I don't like coding, I like to exploring Web Design using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.

You can see my design portfolio that I build using webflow through the link 👉 <a href="https://julyo11.webflow.io/" target="_blank">julyo11.webflow.io</a><br>

Thank you and have a nice day ❤️
